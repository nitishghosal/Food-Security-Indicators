# Food-Security-Indicators

### “In a world of plenty, no one, not a single person, should go hungry. But almost 1 billion still do not have enough to eat.”
                                       - Ban Ki-moon, United Nations Secretary-General

## Problem Background
With the world’s population expected to grow from 7 billion to 9 billion, a growth of 30%, in the next four decades, the demand on our food and agriculture systems will be greater than ever.Food security is one of the 17 sustainable development goals(SDG) in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development .The international community is committed to ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition worldwide by 2030 spearheaded by the United Nations through a deliberative process involving its 193 Member States, as well as global civil society and the private sector.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis of the data hosted on the FAOSTATS portal and identify the critical factors that impact agriculture and food security around the world as well as identify the countries where the food security problem is most severe so that adequate resources could be diverted in that region in order to improve the situation.

## Approach
Exploratory data analysis was performed for the dataset after data scraping,cleaning and normalization. Data was transformed into smaller tidy datasets which were used to find trends for specific indicators.The trends and insights are presented in the form of intutive,interactive and easy to understand visualizations.

## Solution Overview
This project is aimed at providing a deeper understanding on the various factors that impact hunger and food secuirty and tries to provide an integrated, concise and easy to understand report on the status of food security in the world.

The dataset contains data for 245 countries/regions across 23 key indicator categories for the period of 1999-2016.

Through the exploratory data analysis performed, it is also explored whether the UN will be able to reach its goal of ending world hunger by 2030.
